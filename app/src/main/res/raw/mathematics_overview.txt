Mathematics is the study of numbers, structures, space, and change. It provides the foundation for fields such as physics, engineering, finance, and computer science. Mathematical concepts are used in cryptography, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and modeling complex systems. Mathematicians work in research, education, and industries like technology, banking, and aerospace, solving real-world problems with mathematical theories and computational techniques.
