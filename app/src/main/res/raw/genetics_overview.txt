Genetics is the branch of biology that studies genes, heredity, and variation in living organisms. It explores how traits are passed from one generation to another and the role of DNA in the development of life. Advances in genetics have led to breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Geneticists work in fields such as gene therapy, forensics, and genomics research, improving our understanding of diseases and evolutionary biology.
